# DungeonFlask
A Dungeons &amp; Dragons character sheet Flask app.

# Motivation
I wanted to design a practical and useful application to help manage data for a family-favorite game. 
Erasing and rewriting or simply reprinting character sheets is a hassle, so storing your characters online
simplifies managing your characters.

# Language/Frameworks
1) Backend - Python3, Google Firestore
2) Frontend - HTML, Jinja, Bootstrap
3) Testing - TravisCI, Pytest
4) Deployment - Docker, Google Cloud Run

# Features
1) Create an account, login and logout freely

--- Development ---<br/>
4) User data held in sessions to ensure backend and frontend communicate properly
5) Appropriate routes guarded by login requirement
6) Tested and integrated with TravisCI
